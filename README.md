# free_moving_mice
Mouse movement analysis scripts developed for the Biophotonics Imaging Technology (BIT) Lab. Specifically:

- plot speed and angular speed frequency histogram
- plot speed and angular speed over time
- plot trajectory color-coded by speed or angular speed
- create movie of mouse movement
